SUMMARY

Senior/lead software engineer, specializing in developing iOS and Mac apps, but curious about
everything.

I love solving hard problems, learning new domains, and creating big systems that are
manageable and amenable to change. In order to help my whole team succeed, I find and remove
obstacles, answer a lot of smart questions, and try to ask even more dumb questions.

July 2012  August 2014

Lead engineer on the Twitter Cards canvas team.

Cards are a way of attaching dynamic interactive content to tweets, based on a custom
markup language, with renderers integrated in the iOS, Android, and Web Twitter clients.
Cards can:

Present content like article summaries, photo galleries, and video players
Show customized ads to promote mobile apps, generate leads, and promote
products
Handle app ""deep links"", App Store integration, and install tracking
Present custom experiences for events like World Cup scores and Oscars polls
Allow third parties to integrate into Twitter

I started by implementing the cards renderer for iOS, then also took responsibility for the
markup language compiler in the backend, written in Scala.

Coordinated with the teams running the cards backend and publishing tools, and assisted
internal and third-party teams using and creating cards. Helped set our feature roadmap
and quarterly goals, planned new features, and wrote architecture documents for
engineers and execs.
