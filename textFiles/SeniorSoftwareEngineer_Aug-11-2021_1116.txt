SUMMARY

Senior/lead software engineer, specializing in developing iOS and Mac apps, but curious about
everything.

I love solving hard problems, learning new domains, and creating big systems that are
manageable and amenable to change. In order to help my whole team succeed, I find and remove
obstacles, answer a lot of smart questions, and try to ask even more dumb questions.

EXPERIENCE
AND HISTORY

Software Engineer, Apple
August 2014 

Working on the UIKit team.

Staff Software Engineer, Twitter
July 2012  August 2014

Lead engineer on the Twitter Cards canvas team.

Cards are a way of attaching dynamic interactive content to tweets, based on a custom
markup language, with renderers integrated in the iOS, Android, and Web Twitter clients.
Cards can:

Present content like article summaries, photo galleries, and video players
Show customized ads to promote mobile apps, generate leads, and promote
products
Handle app "deep links", App Store integration, and install tracking
Present custom experiences for events like World Cup scores and Oscars polls
Allow third parties to integrate into Twitter

I started by implementing the cards renderer for iOS, then also took responsibility for the
markup language compiler in the backend, written in Scala.

Coordinated with the teams running the cards backend and publishing tools, and assisted
internal and third-party teams using and creating cards. Helped set our feature roadmap
and quarterly goals, planned new features, and wrote architecture documents for
engineers and execs.

Senior Software Engineer, Avatron Software
October 2011  July 2012

Developed a new iOS / Mac remote access product, Air Login.

On the Mac, implemented a system-level coordination daemon, per-user screen capture
agent, and controller UI, all communicating via XPC. On iOS, prototyped the client app.

Senior Software Engineer, Apple
January 2003  April 2010

Shipped several releases of Keynote, Pages, Numbers, and iWeb, on both Mac and iPad.

For iWork on iPad: Designed and implemented a Core Animation-based graphics and
interaction framework. On a tight schedule, we built a revolutionary touch-based UI,
pushing the limits of an untried OS and hardware, and shipped all three apps on time with

the first iPad.

For iWork and iWeb on Mac: Was lead engineer for our graphics framework, built on
OpenGL and Quartz. Designed and implemented new features, from high-level UI to low-
level details, across the whole suite. While we were primarily responsible for graphics and
interaction, I also had a hand in text layout and rendering, document storage,
import/export, performance, and HTML widgets.

Led a team of three engineers. Wrote, triaged, analyzed, and fixed thousands of bug
reports. Ran daily scrum meetings, estimated schedules, planned feature sets for releases,
wrote prototypes and documentation, and filed for patents. Coordinated with design,
engineering, QA, product management, and marketing.

Senior Software Engineer, The Omni Group

Transcripts.
Added features to, and fixed bugs in, the web browser OmniWeb (winner of two
Apple Design Awards in 2001).
For the online store of a major software company: cleaned up the architecture,
upgraded code to modern standards, and fixed bugs.
Wrote Mac OS X, Windows, and WebObjects applications that worked with
relational databases (Oracle, FrontBase, DB2, and Sybase).
